Usage
=====

Requirements
------------

* flask
* flask-login
* flask-wtf
* flask-sqlalchemy
* sqlalchemy
* ldap3
* numpy
* [Sortable](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable/)
* [slackutils](https://github.com/spurll/slackutils/) (optional, for notifications via Slack)

Configuration
-------------

[Sortable](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable/) is used as a Git submodule. To initialize the submodule after cloning the Vote repository run:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You'll also need to create a `config.py` file, which specifies details such as which method to use to select winning votes (instant runoff, Condorcet, etc.), how many winners to select, how to post notifications of the winners, etc. A sample configuration file can be found at `sample_config.py`.

Before starting the server for the first time, run `db_create.py`.

Starting the Server
-------------------

Start the server with `run.py`. By default it will be accessible at `localhost:9999`. To make the server world-accessible or for other options, see `run.py -h`.

Special Thanks

Vote was based on the earlier [Lunch Voter](https://github.com/spurll/lunch). The `weighted_sample` selection function was designed by Eric Davies. [Curtis Vogt](https://github.com/omus) did quite a bit of work on the front end.
